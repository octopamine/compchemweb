## Install Node
https://nodejs.org/en/


## Install Node with NVM (Node Version Manager) (recommended)
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md

- nvm allows you to switch between node versions for different projects
- when opening this app, you can run ```nvm use``` to switch to node version set for this project in ```.nvmrcc``` file.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
